# E-commerce Client

This project was built for Codecademy's Full Stack Engineering Path.

It is a follow-up on the [E-commerce RESTful API](https://github.com/Pedro-Freddi/ecommerce-api) project, with the goal of designing a user interface that communicates with the API. The result is a client-side rendered clothing e-commerce website named "Clothes Store" (very creative).

The project's plan can be found in the [docs folder](./docs).

The deployed version can be viewed [here](https://clothes-store-pdafr.netlify.app/).
